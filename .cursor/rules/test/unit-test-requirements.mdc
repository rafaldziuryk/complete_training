# Unit Test Requirements for Features and Screens

For every screen/feature in the project, the following unit test requirements MUST be met:

- There MUST be unit tests for:
    - The corresponding **BLoC** (see [dependency-injection-architecture.mdc](mdc:dependency-injection-architecture.mdc), [error-handling-patterns.mdc](mdc:error-handling-patterns.mdc))
    - All **UseCases** used by the screen (see [flutter-clean-architecture.mdc](mdc:flutter-clean-architecture.mdc))
    - All **Repositories** used by the screen (see [flutter-clean-architecture.mdc](mdc:flutter-clean-architecture.mdc))
- All unit tests MUST use the [mocktail](https://pub.dev/packages/mocktail) package for mocking dependencies and verifying interactions.
- Tests MUST cover:
    - Success scenarios
    - Error/failure scenarios (see [error-handling-patterns.mdc](mdc:error-handling-patterns.mdc))
    - Edge cases and input validation
- Tests MUST be placed in the appropriate `test/features/[feature]/` directory, mirroring the structure of the `lib/features/[feature]/` directory.
- All new screens/features MUST include these tests before being marked as complete in the checklist.
