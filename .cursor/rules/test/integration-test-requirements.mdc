# Integration Test Requirements for Every Screen

For every screen in the project, the following integration test requirements MUST be met:

- There MUST be an integration test that:
    - Launches the screen via the app's navigation (see [go-router-navigation.mdc](mdc:../go-router-navigation.mdc))
    - Navigates to all other screens accessible from this screen
    - Interacts with **all buttons** on the screen (taps/clicks)
    - Fills out **all input fields** (TextFields, dropdowns, etc.) with valid and invalid data
    - Verifies that the UI responds correctly to these interactions (e.g., navigation, error messages, state changes)
- Integration tests MUST be placed in the appropriate `integration_test/` directory, mirroring the structure of the `lib/features/[feature]/` directory where possible.
- All new screens/features MUST include these integration tests before being marked as complete in the checklist.
